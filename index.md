We've all been there. It's been "a week". You're wondering what to eat and you're so over
leftovers. You want something fresh and delicious, but you're tired of boring old takeout.
And who can afford takeout every night?!

If you feel that, then you should try this amazing recipe. Prep time is 5 minutes, and within
30 minutes you'll be eating a delicious. Best part? Minimal cleanup.

#### Ingredients

1. Phone / Computer or other device
2. A friend named Ray

#### Steps

Step 1: Text your friend Ray `Hey Ray, can you pick up some urban vegan?`

This can be over SMS, Slack, Signal or even email. Get creative! Incorporate your favorite medium
to really make this dish your own.

Step 2: Wait 30 minutes

This part is arguably the hardest. I personally enjoy reading a nice book, or looking happily out
a window while I play soft music and swirl a glass of wine.

That's all there is to it! We know this recipe doesn't work for everyone, but if you've got
the ingredients you should try it out soon. You won't regret it.
